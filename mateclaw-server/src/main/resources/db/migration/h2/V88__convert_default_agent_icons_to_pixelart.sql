-- Convert the three default seed agents from emoji to pixelarticons icons.
-- The card UI now treats `pi:<name>` as an inline pixel-art SVG, so the
-- defaults need to match. Guarded with the original emoji so a user who
-- already customised the icon keeps their choice; non-seed (user-created)
-- agents are intentionally untouched.
