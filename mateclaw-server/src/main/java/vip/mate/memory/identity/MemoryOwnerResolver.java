/**
 * Resolves the {@code owner_key} that conversation-derived memory should be
 * attributed to, from the request's {@link ChatOrigin}.
 *
 * <p>The key is a prefixed string so a single agent shared across surfaces
 * keeps every subject's memory separate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Web console  → {@code user:<requesterId>} (the MateClaw username)</li>
 *   <li>IM channels  → {@code <channelType>:<senderId>} (feishu/dingtalk/…)</li>
 *   <li>WebChat / 3rd-party API → {@code api:<visitorId|endUserId>}</li>
 *   <li>Cron / system / unknown → {@link #SYSTEM_OWNER}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The cron/system fallback is deliberate: it keeps unattributed writes out of
 * any real user's PERSONAL bucket (which would otherwise be a black hole that
 * nobody can read) — such writes are expected to be TEAM-scoped instead.
