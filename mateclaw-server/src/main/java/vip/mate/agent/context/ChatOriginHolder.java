/**
 * Request-scoped {@link ChatOrigin} bridge between {@code AgentService}'s

 *
 * <p>RFC-063r §2.5 carries the origin end-to-end via Spring AI {@code ToolContext}
 * once it lands in graph state. This holder is the small bridge that gets the
 * origin from the AgentService method invocation into the graph's initial
 * state map — the holder lifecycle is bounded by the AgentService method
 * call (set on entry, cleared in {@code finally}). Once written into the
 * graph state under {@link vip.mate.agent.graph.state.MateClawStateKeys#CHAT_ORIGIN},
 * the rest of the runtime reads via the typed accessor — no further ThreadLocal
 * access. Mirrors {@link vip.mate.agent.ThinkingLevelHolder}.
